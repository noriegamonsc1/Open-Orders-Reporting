    """
    Fetches the latest report files from specified directories.

    This function reads a secrets JSON file that contains directory paths,
    identifies the latest report files in those directories, and returns
    a dictionary mapping folder names to the latest file paths.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    secrets_file_path : str
        The path to the JSON file containing directory paths.

    Returns:
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary where keys are folder names and values are the latest file paths.
        If a folder has no files, the value will be None.
    
    Example:
    --------
    >>> secrets_file_path = '../../config/secrets.json'
    >>> latest_files = fetch_latest_reports(secrets_file_path)
    >>> print(latest_files)
    {'folder1': 'path/to/latest/report1.csv', 'folder2': None}
